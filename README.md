# GamepadHID
This is my code for a Pro Micro which is used as a HID Device.

Requirements:
HID Project from: https://github.com/NicoHood/HID

B16LReplicaV1.0.zip is a Custom Device. 
In the Boards.txt you can change the pid, vid and the name of the HID Device. 
Just extract it and add it to your hardware folder under C:/Users/User/Documents/Arduino.
Then restart the IDE. Now you can select the board.
